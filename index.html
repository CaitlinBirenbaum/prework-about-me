      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi there! I am a 22 year old student with WashU Coding Bootcamp!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised here in St. Louis, but I've travelled all over the world, from New York to Ecuador!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm a writer, and am currently working on my second draft of my first novel. In my spare time I like to read, cook, and watch interesting documentaries.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't have one! As long as I am helping other people, and able to make a comfortable living, I'm happy.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in St. Louis with my parents.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer to help people reach their creative goals, and to make their everyday lives better. I would love to combine my love for writing and coding together to develop a website to connect authors and readers together on an intimate platform. I'm also very passionate about developing programs to aid people that are neurodivergent or physically impaired.</p>
